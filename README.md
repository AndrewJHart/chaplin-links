chaplin-links
=============

## An application built for learning how to use [Chaplinjs] (https://github.com/chaplinjs).

### What does it do:
* Bookmark a link with tags.
* Filter bookmarks by tag.

### Requirements:
* Node (see: [nvm] (https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* [mongoDB] (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart) (I have by-passed this step by setting up a free account on [mongolab] (https://mongolab.com))

### How to run:
* If coffe is not installed: `sudo npm install -g coffee`
* Move into the application root directory and install dependencies: `npm install .`
* Start the server: `node app.js`
