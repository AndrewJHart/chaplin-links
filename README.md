### An application built for learning how to use [Chaplinjs] (https://github.com/chaplinjs)

## Key Features
This is a very simple bookmark application (mostly coded over 2 weekends). With it, one can bookmark links and filter them by tags. Links and Tags are 2 independent models-collections within the application, the only connection being the Link model having a Tags attribute. It relies on a node-express server and a mongodb database on the back-end and one would rightly say... far too simple for a Chaplin architecture!

## Requirements
* Node (see: [nvm] (https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* [mongoDB] (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart) (I have by-passed this step by setting up a free account on [mongolab] (https://mongolab.com))

## How to run
```
# Clone the repo into your home directory (or wherever you want...)
cd
git@github.com:deciob/chaplin-links.git
cd ~/chaplin-links

# If no coffeescript
sudo npm install -g coffee

# Install server dependencies
npm install .

# Edit connection_string_template.js to point to your mongodb database
# and save the file as connection_string.js

# Runserver and go to localhost:3000
node app.js

# To compile coffee changes to js
coffee --bare --output js/ coffee/ 

```

## Motivation
My goal is to learn Chaplin. I am not totally new to the JavaScript MV* hype and have built a couple of fairly complex one page JavaScript applications using spinejs. I have been flirting with backbone for some time now, curious about its popularity, but never got to try it out until... Chaplin came along...

Started with backbone. My first Backbone weekend though, full of source code, blog posts and tutorials, was one of frustration... so many ways of doing the same thing! Beautiful, but also so frustrating for a not-so-brilliant-developer like me, with not so much free time to spare. I needed some good pragmatic guidance! After 2 days, I had very little working code and no real understanding about what was best. So, the weekend after, with not much enthusiasm left, I ditched Backbone for Chaplin and...

â€¦ beautiful surprise! After reading the presentation once more and some good poking into the source code and example applications, I had this learning application up and running and, most important, I was having fun building it!
